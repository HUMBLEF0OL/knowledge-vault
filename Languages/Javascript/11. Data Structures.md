### Section 11: **JavaScript Data Structures**

JavaScript provides several built-in data structures that can be utilized to store and manage collections of data. This section covers the most commonly used data structures, their properties, and how to work with them effectively.

#### 11.1 Arrays

Arrays are ordered collections of values. They can hold any type of data, including objects and other arrays. Arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0.

##### Example:
```javascript
const fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'];
console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: Apple
console.log(fruits.length); // Output: 3

// Adding an item
fruits.push('Date');
console.log(fruits); // Output: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date']

// Removing an item
fruits.pop();
console.log(fruits); // Output: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry']
```

#### 11.2 Objects

Objects are collections of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or Symbols) and values can be any data type. Objects are ==**unordered**== and mutable.

##### Example:
```javascript
const person = {
    name: 'Alice',
    age: 25,
    greet: function() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
    }
};

console.log(person.name); // Output: Alice
person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice.
```

#### 11.3 Sets

A `Set` is a collection of unique values. Sets are useful when you want to ensure that no duplicate values are stored. They maintain the insertion order of elements.

##### Example:
```javascript
const uniqueNumbers = new Set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]);
console.log(uniqueNumbers); // Output: Set { 1, 2, 3 }

// Adding a value
uniqueNumbers.add(4);
console.log(uniqueNumbers); // Output: Set { 1, 2, 3, 4 }

// Checking existence
console.log(uniqueNumbers.has(2)); // Output: true
console.log(uniqueNumbers.has(5)); // Output: false
```

#### 11.4 Maps

A `Map` is a collection of key-value pairs where keys can be of any data type, including objects. Maps maintain the insertion order of elements.

##### Example:
```javascript
const map = new Map();
map.set('name', 'Alice');
map.set('age', 25);
map.set('isStudent', true);

console.log(map.get('name')); // Output: Alice
console.log(map.has('age')); // Output: true

// Iterating over a Map
map.forEach((value, key) => {
    console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
});
// Output:
// name: Alice
// age: 25
// isStudent: true


// Create a new Map 
let myMap = new Map(); 
// Create an object 
let objKey = { id: 1, name: "John" }; 
// Use the object as a key in the Map 
myMap.set(objKey, "Some value"); 
// Accessing the value using the object as the key 
console.log(myMap.get(objKey)); 
// Output: "Some value"
```

#### 11.5 WeakSets

A `WeakSet` is similar to a `Set`, but it only holds weak references to its elements. This means that if there are no other references to an object, it can be garbage collected. WeakSets can only hold objects.

##### Example:
```javascript
const weakSet = new WeakSet();
let obj = { name: 'Alice' };
weakSet.add(obj);

console.log(weakSet.has(obj)); // Output: true

obj = null; // Now the object is eligible for garbage collection
```

##### Key Characteristics of WeakSet

1. **Weak References**: The references to the objects stored in a `WeakSet` are weak, meaning if there are no other references to an object, it can be garbage collected, and the corresponding entry in the `WeakSet` is removed. This contrasts with a regular `Set`, which maintains strong references to its entries.
    
2. **Only Objects**: A `WeakSet` can only hold objects as its elements. Primitive values (like numbers, strings, or booleans) cannot be added to a `WeakSet`.
    
3. **No Iteration**: You cannot iterate over the elements of a `WeakSet` since the collection does not maintain an internal list of its elements. This helps keep memory usage low and aligns with the weak referencing mechanism.
    
4. **No Size Property**: `WeakSet` does not have a `size` property. Therefore, you cannot directly get the number of objects it holds.
    
5. **Methods**: A `WeakSet` provides three methods:
    
    - `add(value)`: Adds a new object to the `WeakSet`.
    - `delete(value)`: Removes an object from the `WeakSet`.
    - `has(value)`: Checks if an object is present in the `WeakSet`.

#### 11.6 WeakMaps

A `WeakMap` is similar to a `Map`, but its keys must be objects, and the references to the keys are weak. This allows objects to be garbage collected if there are no other references to them.

##### Example:
```javascript
const weakMap = new WeakMap();
let obj = {};
weakMap.set(obj, 'some value');

console.log(weakMap.get(obj)); // Output: some value

obj = null; // Now the object is eligible for garbage collection
```

##### Key Characteristics of WeakMap

1. **Weak References**: Keys in a `WeakMap` are weakly referenced. If there are no other references to a key object, it can be garbage collected, preventing memory leaks.
    
2. **Object Keys Only**: Only objects (including arrays and functions) can be used as keys. Primitive values (like strings or numbers) are not allowed.
    
3. **Non-iterable**: `WeakMap` does not support iteration. You cannot use methods like `forEach`, and thereâ€™s no way to get an array of keys or values.
    
4. **No Size Property**: Unlike `Map`, `WeakMap` has no `size` property, so you cannot check how many entries it contains.
    
5. **Methods**: It provides four methods:
    
    - `set(key, value)`: Adds a key-value pair.
    - `get(key)`: Retrieves the value for a given key.
    - `has(key)`: Checks if a key exists.
    - `delete(key)`: Removes a key-value pair.
