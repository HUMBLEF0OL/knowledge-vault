### Section 4: **Asynchronous JavaScript**
#### Synchronous vs. Asynchronous: Understanding the Difference

##### Synchronous
In JavaScript, synchronous programming means code executes one line at a time, in the order it's written. Each line waits for the previous one to finish before moving on.

**Synchronous Example:**
```javascript
console.log("Start");
console.log("Middle");
console.log("End");
```

**Output:**
```
Start
Middle
End
```
In this example, the output appears in the exact order the code is written, from start to end.

##### Asynchronous
In asynchronous programming, tasks are started, but the code doesn't wait for them to complete before moving on. Once the task is done, its result is handled using **callbacks**, **promises**, or **async/await**.

**Asynchronous Example:**
```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Inside Timeout");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
```

**Output:**
```
Start
End
Inside Timeout
```
Here, the `setTimeout` function starts a timer, but the script continues to run. The message "End" is printed before the timer finishes and "Inside Timeout" is logged.

## How JavaScript Manages Asynchronous Tasks

JavaScript handles asynchronous tasks using a combination of the **Call Stack**, **Web APIs**, **Callback Queue**, and the **Event Loop**. These work together to ensure the code runs without blocking other tasks.

---

Asynchronous programming allows JavaScript to handle operations like network requests, file reading, or timers without blocking the main execution thread. This is crucial for building responsive web applications.

#### 4.1 Callbacks

A callback is a function passed into another function as an argument. It gets executed after the completion of the asynchronous operation.

##### Example:
```javascript
function fetchData(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        const data = { id: 1, name: "Alice" };
        callback(data);
    }, 2000); // Simulates a network request
}

fetchData((data) => {
    console.log("Data received:", data); // Output: Data received: { id: 1, name: 'Alice' }
});
```

#### 4.2 [[7.2 Promises]]

A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. It can be in one of three states: **pending**, **fulfilled**, or **rejected**.

##### Creating a Promise:
```javascript
const fetchData = () => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            const data = { id: 1, name: "Alice" };
            resolve(data); // Successfully fetched data
            // reject("Error fetching data"); // Uncomment to simulate error
        }, 2000);
    });
};

// Using the promise
fetchData()
    .then((data) => {
        console.log("Data received:", data); // Output: Data received: { id: 1, name: 'Alice' }
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.log(error); // Output: Error message if rejected
    });
```

+------------------+
|      Pending     |
+--------+---------+
         |
  Resolves |
         V

|     Fulfilled    |
+------------------+
         |
  Rejects  |
         V

|     Rejected     |

```

#### 4.3 [[7.3 Async-Await]]

`async/await` is syntactic sugar built on top of promises. It makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code, improving readability.

##### Example:
```javascript
const fetchData = () => {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            const data = { id: 1, name: "Alice" };
            resolve(data);
        }, 2000);
    });
};

const getData = async () => {
    try {
        const data = await fetchData();
        console.log("Data received:", data); // Output: Data received: { id: 1, name: 'Alice' }
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(error);
    }
};

getData();
```

#### 4.4 Error Handling

Proper error handling is essential in asynchronous programming. Using `.catch()` with promises or `try/catch` with `async/await` helps manage errors gracefully.

##### Example with Promises:
```javascript
fetchData()
    .then((data) => {
        console.log("Data received:", data);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.log("Error:", error);
    });
```

##### Example with async/await:
```javascript
const getData = async () => {
    try {
        const data = await fetchData();
        console.log("Data received:", data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.log("Error:", error);
    }
};
```
