### Section 9: **JavaScript Best Practices**

Following best practices can lead to more maintainable, efficient, and readable JavaScript code. This section outlines important conventions and techniques to consider when writing JavaScript.

#### 9.1 Use `const` and `let` Instead of `var`

- Use `const` for variables that will not be reassigned.
- Use `let` for variables that will be reassigned.
- Avoid `var` as it has function scope, which can lead to confusion.

##### Example:
```javascript
const pi = 3.14; // constant value
let count = 0;   // can be reassigned
```

---

#### 9.2 Use [[Strict Mode]]

Enabling strict mode can help you write cleaner code by enforcing stricter parsing and error handling in your JavaScript code.

##### Example:
```javascript
"use strict";

function myFunction() {
    x = 3.14; // Throws an error because x is not declared
}
myFunction();
```

---

#### 9.3 Avoid Global Variables

Minimizing the use of global variables helps prevent naming conflicts and makes your code easier to maintain. Use closures or modules to encapsulate variables.

##### Example:
```javascript
(function() {
    let privateVariable = "I am private";
    
    function privateFunction() {
        console.log(privateVariable);
    }

    privateFunction(); // Output: I am private
})();
```

---

#### 9.4 Keep Your Code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

Repetitive code can lead to bugs and makes maintenance harder. Use functions, modules, or classes to encapsulate reusable code.

##### Example:
```javascript
function calculateArea(width, height) {
    return width * height;
}

// Usage
const area1 = calculateArea(5, 10);
const area2 = calculateArea(2, 3);
```

---

#### 9.5 Use Descriptive Variable and Function Names

Choose clear, descriptive names for variables and functions to make your code self-documenting and easier to understand.

##### Example:
```javascript
function calculateTotalPrice(price, tax) {
    return price + (price * tax);
}
```

---

#### 9.6 Document Your Code

Use comments to explain complex logic or provide context about the code. Additionally, consider using [[JSDoc]] for documenting functions and their parameters.

##### Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the total price including tax.
 * @param {number} price - The base price.
 * @param {number} tax - The tax percentage (e.g., 0.2 for 20%).
 * @returns {number} The total price.
 */
function calculateTotalPrice(price, tax) {
    return price + (price * tax);
}
```

---

#### 9.7 [[12. Error Handling]]

Use `try...catch` for error handling to prevent your application from crashing. Ensure you provide meaningful error messages to help debug issues.

##### Example:
```javascript
try {
    // Code that may throw an error
    const result = riskyFunction();
} catch (error) {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error.message);
}
```
