### **Next.js Notes - Chapter 1: Introduction to Next.js 14.2 (App Router)**

#### **1. What is Next.js?**
Next.js is a React framework that offers powerful features like **server-side rendering (SSR)**, **static site generation (SSG)**, and **incremental static regeneration (ISR)**. It's developed by **Vercel** and is designed to simplify the building of production-ready, full-stack applications with both front-end and back-end integration. The latest version, **Next.js 14.2**, introduces enhanced support for caching, CSS optimization, and memory management for large applications.

- **Official Documentation**: [Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs)  
- **GitHub Repository**: [Next.js GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)

#### **2. Key Features of Next.js 14.2**
   - **File-based routing**: Pages are created using files inside the `app` directory. No need to use `react-router-dom`; simply create files or folders to define routes.
   - **Automatic code splitting**: Only the JavaScript necessary for the page is served, improving performance.
   - **Image optimization**: The built-in `<Image />` component automatically optimizes images, reducing file size and improving load times.
   - **CSS and styling improvements**: CSS optimization and chunking have been enhanced to reduce conflicts between styles when navigating across pages【12†source】【13†source】.
   - **SSR and SSG**: Next.js pre-renders every page by default. You can opt for SSR or SSG with `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`.
   - **API Routes**: Full back-end integration with API routes created in the `app/api` directory.
   - **App Router with Nested Layouts**: New app router in version 13+ with support for **parallel routes**, **intercepting routes**, and nested layouts, enhancing routing flexibility【12†source】.

#### **3. Getting Started with Next.js 14.2**
   - **Project Setup**:
     - Install Next.js by running: 
       ```bash
       npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
       ```
     - When prompted, select the `App Router` option to work with the latest features.
   - **Directory Structure**:
     - `app/`: Contains the pages and components.
     - `app/api/`: Create API routes (full-stack features).
     - `_app.js`: Used for global styles and common layout.
   - **Routing**:
     - Next.js uses **file-based routing**, meaning that every file inside the `app/` directory corresponds to a route.
     - For dynamic routes, you can create a file like `[id].js` inside the folder, allowing for flexible URL parameters.

   - **Basic Example of App Router**:
     ```jsx
     // app/page.js
     export default function Home() {
       return <h1>Welcome to Next.js 14.2 with App Router</h1>;
     }
     ```
   - **Dynamic Routing Example**:
     ```jsx
     // app/[id]/page.js
     export default function DynamicPage({ params }) {
       return <h1>Dynamic Page for {params.id}</h1>;
     }
     ```
