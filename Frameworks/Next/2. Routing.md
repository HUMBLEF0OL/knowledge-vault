### **Next.js Notes - Chapter 2: Routing in Next.js 14.2 with App Router**

#### **1. Overview of Routing in Next.js**
Next.js simplifies routing by offering a **file-based routing** system. Each file in the `app/` directory automatically becomes a route. There is no need for a third-party routing library like `react-router-dom`, making routing more intuitive and seamless. This chapter focuses on the **App Router**, which provides advanced routing features like parallel and nested layouts introduced in the later versions of Next.js.

- **Key Concepts**:
  - **File-based Routing**: Folders and files in `app/` map directly to URLs.
  - **Dynamic Routes**: Use brackets (`[]`) for dynamic segments, e.g., `[id].js` creates a dynamic route.
  - **Layouts**: Next.js supports layouts at any level, allowing nested layouts for complex page structures.
  - **Parallel and Intercepting Routes**: New features in the App Router that allow routing flexibility.

#### **2. File-based Routing**
   - **Basic Pages**:
     Files in the `app/` directory automatically map to routes. For example:
     - `app/page.js` maps to `/`.
     - `app/about/page.js` maps to `/about`.
     
     Example:
     ```jsx
     // app/about/page.js
     export default function About() {
       return <h1>About Us</h1>;
     }
     ```
   
   - **Dynamic Routing**:
     To create dynamic routes, use square brackets (`[]`). For example, a file `app/product/[id]/page.js` maps to `/product/:id`.
     
     Example:
     ```jsx
     // app/product/[id]/page.js
     export default function ProductPage({ params }) {
       return <h1>Product ID: {params.id}</h1>;
     }
     ```
   
   - **Catch-All Routes**:
     Use `[...slug].js` for catch-all routes. This will match any path under a specific route.
     
     Example:
     ```jsx
     // app/blog/[...slug]/page.js
     export default function BlogPost({ params }) {
       return <h1>Post Slug: {params.slug.join('/')}</h1>;
     }
     ```

#### **3. Nested Layouts in App Router**
Next.js 14.2â€™s App Router introduces **nested layouts**, allowing you to create reusable layouts at different levels of your application.

   - **Creating Layouts**:
     Layouts are defined using `layout.js` files. Any file named `layout.js` inside the `app/` directory will wrap the contents of its sibling files (including other layouts).
     
     Example:
     ```jsx
     // app/layout.js
     export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
       return (
         <html>
           <body>{children}</body>
         </html>
       );
     }
     ```

   - **Nested Layouts**:
     Nested layouts are possible by creating additional `layout.js` files at deeper directory levels. This allows different sections of your site to have specific layouts.
     
     Example:
     ```jsx
     // app/dashboard/layout.js
     export default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {
       return (
         <div>
           <nav>Dashboard Navigation</nav>
           <main>{children}</main>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

#### **4. Parallel Routes and Intercepting Routes**
   - **Parallel Routes**:
     Parallel routes allow rendering multiple routes at the same time. These routes can update independently without affecting each other. This is useful for apps that require multiple views side by side, such as dashboards.
     
     Example:
     ```jsx
     // app/dashboard/@settings/page.js
     export default function Settings() {
       return <div>Settings View</div>;
     }
     ```

   - **Intercepting Routes**:
     Intercepting routes allow a route to interrupt and display content in a different location without changing the URL. This is useful for modals or side panels.

   - **Usage Example**:  
     Intercepting routes are still evolving in the ecosystem. Check for updates in the official [Next.js routing documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction).

#### **5. API Routes**
   - **Full-stack Capabilities**:
     Next.js lets you create API routes using the `app/api` directory, meaning you can handle server-side logic directly within your Next.js app. API routes are typically used for server-side processing such as database interaction, user authentication, etc.
     
     Example:
     ```jsx
     // app/api/hello/route.js
     export async function GET(request) {
       return new Response(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Hello World' }));
     }
     ```
