### Section 4: **Asynchronous JavaScript**
#### Synchronous vs. Asynchronous: Understanding the Difference

##### Synchronous
In JavaScript, synchronous programming means code executes one line at a time, in the order it's written. Each line waits for the previous one to finish before moving on.

**Synchronous Example:**
```javascript
console.log("Start");
console.log("Middle");
console.log("End");
```

**Output:**
```
Start
Middle
End
```
In this example, the output appears in the exact order the code is written, from start to end.

##### Asynchronous
In asynchronous programming, tasks are started, but the code doesn't wait for them to complete before moving on. Once the task is done, its result is handled using **callbacks**, **promises**, or **async/await**.

**Asynchronous Example:**
```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Inside Timeout");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
```

**Output:**
```
Start
End
Inside Timeout
```
Here, the `setTimeout` function starts a timer, but the script continues to run. The message "End" is printed before the timer finishes and "Inside Timeout" is logged.

## How JavaScript Manages Asynchronous Tasks

JavaScript handles asynchronous tasks using a combination of the **Call Stack**, **Web APIs**, **Callback Queue**, and the **Event Loop**. These work together to ensure the code runs without blocking other tasks.

Asynchronous programming allows JavaScript to handle operations like network requests, file reading, or timers without blocking the main execution thread. This is crucial for building responsive web applications.

#### 4.1 Callbacks

A callback is a function passed into another function as an argument. It gets executed after the completion of the asynchronous operation.

##### Example:
```javascript
function fetchData(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        const data = { id: 1, name: "Alice" };
        callback(data);
    }, 2000); // Simulates a network request
}

fetchData((data) => {
    console.log("Data received:", data); // Output: Data received: { id: 1, name: 'Alice' }
});
```

#### 4.2 [[Promises]]

A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. It can be in one of three states: **pending**, **fulfilled**, or **rejected**.

##### Creating a Promise:
```javascript
const fetchData = () => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            const data = { id: 1, name: "Alice" };
            resolve(data); // Successfully fetched data
            // reject("Error fetching data"); // Uncomment to simulate error
        }, 2000);
    });
};

// Using the promise
fetchData()
    .then((data) => {
        console.log("Data received:", data); // Output: Data received: { id: 1, name: 'Alice' }
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.log(error); // Output: Error message if rejected
    });
```

+------------------+
|      Pending     |
+--------+---------+
         |
  Resolves |
         V

|     Fulfilled    |
+------------------+
         |
  Rejects  |
         V
+------------------+
|     Rejected     |
+------------------+
```

#### 4.3 [[Async-Await]]

`async/await` is syntactic sugar built on top of promises. It makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code, improving readability.

##### Example:
```javascript
const fetchData = () => {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            const data = { id: 1, name: "Alice" };
            resolve(data);
        }, 2000);
    });
};

const getData = async () => {
    try {
        const data = await fetchData();
        console.log("Data received:", data); // Output: Data received: { id: 1, name: 'Alice' }
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(error);
    }
};

getData();
```

#### 4.4 Error Handling

Proper error handling is essential in asynchronous programming. Using `.catch()` with promises or `try/catch` with `async/await` helps manage errors gracefully.

##### Example with Promises:
```javascript
fetchData()
    .then((data) => {
        console.log("Data received:", data);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.log("Error:", error);
    });
```

##### Example with async/await:
```javascript
const getData = async () => {
    try {
        const data = await fetchData();
        console.log("Data received:", data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.log("Error:", error);
    }
};
```
